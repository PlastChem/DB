> Identifying and addressing chemicals and polymers of concern

<span style="color: red;">This repository contains all the code that was used 
to create the a beta version for the PlastChem DB. This beta version has then 
been manually curated to create version 1.00 which was included as part of the 
launch of the PlastChem report on 2023-03-14.</span>

The [PlastChem](https://zenodo.org/records/10701706) database was assembled from 
the raw data of seven data sets. Five are openly available and this repository 
contains all the necessary information and scripts to assemble their part of the 
PlastChem database. Two data sets were confidentially shared with the project 
team; the scripts for these are omitted until the original data sets become 
openly available, at which point the scripts will be shared as part of the 
repository as well.
